    <p>The “Sufficiently Clever Compiler” has become something of a trope in
the Lisp community: the mythical beast that promises language and
interface designers near-unlimited freedom, and leaves their output in
a performance lurch by its non-appearance. A few years ago, I was
young enough to join a research project to build one of these things.
Neglecting a raft of asterisks, footnotes, and caveats, we ended up
making something whose essence is pretty impressive: you pay for
abstraction boundaries in compile-time resources, but they end up free
at runtime. One
<a href="https://github.com/axch/dysvunctional-language">prototype</a> was just
open-sourced recently, so that makes now a good time to talk about it.</p>
<p>Permit me to begin my musings on this subject with an example. The
next element on this page is a Javascript Canvas object, whereon, upon
your clicking the button labeled “Go!”, your browser will draw a
progressively-refined rendition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot
set</a>, anti-aliased for
your viewing pleasure. It will also display how long each iteration
took to compute, both in real time and in count of floating point
arithmetic operations.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>I obviously don’t know how fast this demo runs on your computer, but
on mine, in Firefox 23.0, with <a href="http://asmjs.org/">asm.js</a> turned on,
I get a little under 1 Mflop/ms. Given that my CPU is 1.6 GHz, that’s
an average of a little over half a floating-point operation per clock
cycle. Not bad for a single-threaded Javascript program, eh?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Doubtless the first difference that jumps out at you is that one of
these programs is written using a beautiful, familiar surface syntax
that makes you feel right at home, while the other uses an ugly,
foreign notation that makes your eyes glaze over. That’s not the
point, though.</p>
<p>The important difference is that the program the browser runs (in
Javascript) is much less modular than the program I want to write (in
Scheme, as it happens). In the Javascript program, all the concepts
relating to Mandelbrot set membership testing are mushed together: the
concepts of complex arithmetic are mixed up with the concept of
iterating a function, and mixed up with the definition of the function
to iterate. None of them are available as named entities; if you
wanted to solve the problem a different way, you would have to rewrite
the entire thing from scratch.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote-display">
<p>
The very advantage of modularity is the
source of its performance cost: modularity is the ability to do things
other than what you did.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Scheme program, however, they are separate definitions, given
their own separate names. Complex arithmetic is defined in one place,
independent of how you choose to use it. The step function defining
the Mandelbrot recurrence is defined in another place, available to be
used any which way you want. The idea of iterating a function for a
while is defined in another place, independent of the function to
iterate. A change of algorithm becomes a matter of rearranging the
available pieces, rather than of rewriting the whole program.</p>
<p>And there we have a clue as to why, in modern computing, modular code
is not high-performance code. The very advantage of modularity is the
source of its performance cost: modularity is the ability to do things
other than what you did. Modularity is the ability to reuse the same
idea in many different ways and in many different places.</p>
<p>The cost that modularity carries is generic linkages between the
“idea” and the “places”. That linkage carries its own cost at
runtime, but more importantly, it impedes other optimizations. In our
example, <code>iterate</code> accepts an arbitrary function <code>f</code>. That means the
call <code>(f x)</code> in iterate has to be set up to call an arbitrary
function. It also means that its argument and its return value have
to be communicated using completely generic mechanisms.</p>
<p>Symmetrically, the function produced by <code>(step c)</code>, being a
first-class object in Scheme, can be used anywhere. That means it has
to accept its argument and produce its return value using completely
generic mechanisms, that match the generic call sites. It also means
that we cannot optimize it by changing its interface, because we do
not know the places where the complementary changes would need to be
made. So <code>(step c)</code> must accept its complex number argument and
return its complex number result each as a single value, presumably
machine-word-sized; so those complex numbers have to be allocated and
dereferenced; and the cost of making those data structures all the
time dwarfs the cost of the arithmetic we are trying to do.</p>
<p>“But wait!” I can hear you say to yourself, “I know what function
<code>iterate</code> is iterating, and I know where <code>(step c)</code> is called. Why is
my compiler so dumb as not to notice that <code>mandelbrot?</code> calls for an
iteration of exactly <code>(step c)</code>, and produce code for it that takes
this into account? Then it would be clear that the complex number
produced by one call to <code>(step c)</code> will just be consumed by the next,
and the program can avoid allocating a silly two-element structure for
it by just passing the two parts in variables.” (Which is, of course,
how the Javascript program behaves.)</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote-display">
<p>
Specialization is the path from modularity to performance.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s right. The thing you did there was a little bit of (combined
data- and control-) flow analysis, computing that <code>iterate</code> gets
called with <code>(step c)</code> as an argument and therefore <code>(step c)</code> appears
as the <code>f</code> in the call <code>(f x)</code> inside <code>iterate</code>. You also decided
that, at least for this problem, it is probably worthwhile to produce
a version of <code>iterate</code> that is specialized to <code>(step c)</code> as an
argument (with due provision for operating on different values of
<code>c</code>). And that’s my point. I conjecture that, at this moment in
history, the one remaining piece of compiler technology that human
programmers instinctively expect before admitting that a compiler is
Sufficiently Clever is the knack for automatically specializing the
right program elements to the context of their use.</p>
<p>Specialization is the path from modularity to performance.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> A modular
component is one that can be used in different ways in different
places. A specialized component is one that is tailored to the way
and place it is used, taking advantage of local context to improve
efficiency; often to the point that separation between component and
context is completely obscured. To the extent that specialization can
be automated, doing so would let us have our cake and eat it
too—write high-performance programs in a modular way.</p>
<p>The problem with specialization is that it comes with its own cost: if
a component is used in many places, specializing it to each context
requires copying it. Since the inside of a component is, of course, a
set of places where other components are used, the number of contexts
grows with each specialization, and, unchecked, this process can
easily get out of hand. That’s why mainstream compilers are pretty
conservative about it.</p>
<p>That being said, there are problem domains where really aggressive
specialization should work wonders. The activity called “scientific
computing” comes to mind: the main item of interest in these programs
is some complicated, CPU- and memory-intensive (as opposed to
I/O-intensive) computation involving floating-point numbers. All the
fine data structures, first-class functions, and abstractions with
which one might wish to write such programs are just scaffolding whose
sole purpose is to get the right floating-point numbers to meet the
right arithmetic operations. So it is tempting to try and see whether
one could write scientific computing programs in a nice, high-level,
modular way, and have the compiler solve the scaffolding at compile
time (by specialization followed by standard optimizations) and
produce efficient numerical code.</p>
<p>That was the theory behind that research project I alluded to in the
introduction. Modern general-purpose compilers do not generally
specialize aggressively enough to “solve the scaffolding” of any
nontrivial program. In particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic
differentiation</a>
is an especially impressive form of scaffolding, that would be
very nice to be able to use, but that tends to trigger “this is too
costly to specialize” heuristics. But perhaps there is a niche for
tools that specialize too much for general-purpose use, but enough to
make (at least some) numerical kernels go really fast despite being
very modular.</p>
<p>I wrote one of those. Under the supervisorship of <a href="http://www-bcl.cs.may.ie/~barak/">Professor
Pearlmutter</a> and with much
assistance from our collaborator <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~qobi/">Professor
Siskind</a>, the research group
studied various issues with semantics and implementation of automatic
differentiation (which are &lt;%= link_to ‘nontrivial’,
‘/ideas/2013-08-15-introduction-to-automatic-differentiation.html’
%&gt;), forays into compiler technology, etc. It so transpired that I
ended up being the primary author of the <a href="https://github.com/axch/dysvunctional-language">DysVunctional
Language</a> prototype,
which specializes away modularity boundaries (including a user-space
automatic differentiation library) until the cows come home.</p>
<p>Now, I do not advocate seriously using DVL (yet), as it is unfinished
(and not very actively worked on right now, for lack of funds). For one, it is
meant for numerical kernels, but it does not have a sensible foreign
interface. For another, it requires programmer
annotations to indicate what not to specialize on (in the complete
absence of which, its flow analysis will amount to running your
program slowly at compile time, and the code generator will amount to
writing an executable that just prints out the answer). It is also
research-prototype quality software in general—for instance, a type
error in the source program will give you a prompt debugging the
compiler.</p>
<p>I am, nevertheless, quite proud of DVL. I flatter myself that its
source is not too terribly hard to read, so it can serve as an example
for how to do that kind of thing in a different context. And the
thing it does, if you get your program to compile, feels pretty
magical: as much abstraction and modularity as you could want gets
stripped away, revealing the bare numerical computation for the
computer to just execute. Not just on podunk 30-line Mandelbrot set
programs, either—check out the <a href="https://github.com/axch/dysvunctional-language/blob/master/dvl/examples/celestial/">celestial
mechanics</a>
example.</p>
<p>Now, DVL is not Sufficiently Clever for general-purpose programming,
because it doesn’t know what not to specialize. That’s an

<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=partial+evaluation">problem</a>, but
it feels to me like the right place to dig.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Here is how I count floating-point operations.
The Mandelbrot set, by definition, is those complex numbers <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> for which
iterating
<span class="math display">\[z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c\]</span>
from <span class="math inline">\(z_0 = 0\)</span> does not escape to infinity. It’s not too hard to
check that, if <span class="math inline">\(|z_n|\)</span> ever exceeds 2, then that iteration will escape
to infinity, regardless of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. This suggests an algorithm for
approximating membership in the Mandelbrot set: for any <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> of interest,
run the iteration for a fixed number of steps. If the result’s magnitude
exceeds 2, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is not in the Mandelbrot set; if it does not, we can
approximately say that <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is in the set.</p>
<p>The program in the demo follows this algorithm. Every iteration
takes 10 arithmetic operations (six for the complex multiply, two for
the complex add, and two for bookkeeping). I chose to go for 400
iterations per point. Every pixel tests 4 points, for the
anti-aliasing. That makes
<span class="math display">\[ 4 \frac{\textrm{points}}{\textrm{pixel}}
   \cdot 400 \frac{\textrm{iters}}{\textrm{point}}
   \cdot 10 \frac{\textrm{flops}}{\textrm{iter}}
   = 16,\!000 \frac{\textrm{flops}}{\textrm{pixel}}, \]</span>
which is where the counts in the table come from.</p>
<p>Aside: It is surely computationally more efficient to check
intermediate steps in the iteration for escaping rather than always
going a fixed number of steps, but that makes counting floating point
operations harder, because you do not know how many get skipped.
That’s why I chose not to do that for this exercise.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>As of this writing, the best program
for computing the Mandelbrot set on the <a href="https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=mandelbrot">Computer Language Benchmarks
Game</a>
(which happened to be written in Fortran 90 and compiled with the Intel Fortran compiler)
was only six times faster than the demo you see here. I do not know
how much of that speedup was due to doing less actual
computation—unlike this demo, that benchmark does truncate its
iterations if they escape early, but the exact savings from this are
hard to measure.<!--
I didn't want to make a footnote to a footnote, so I include my
calculation of that 6 times number in a comment:
- The graphic in the benchmark is 16,000 x 16,000 pixels at 1 point
  per pixel, whereas in the demo it's 500 x 500 pixels at 4 points per
  pixel (for the antialiasing).
- The benchmark iterates the Mandelbrot recursion 50 times, whereas
  the demo does 400.
- The program's best time is 14 seconds, whereas the demo gets 4.
- The benchmark's test processor is 2.4 GHz, whereas mine is 1.6 GHz.
- But, the benchmark permits stopping early is an intermediate point
  is known to escape, and the best program also uses a trick to try
  and save time on doing this test.
If you multiply all that out, you get an advantage of 6x, which mixes in
superiority of compilation (which is what we care about) with algorithmic
improvements and differences in the suitability of the hardware for this
task (e.g., I do not know how many floating point multipliers there are
either in my chip or the processor the benchmark was run on).

<li id="fn3"><p>One quip among compiler writers that expresses this
sentiment is “inlining is the mother of all optimizations”. Inlining
is the act of replacing a reference to some variable with that
variable’s definition; putting the definition “in line”, as it were.
This is particularly helpful if the variable in question refers to a
function.</p>
<p>Inlining can cause acceleration in its own right (for example, by
eliminating the runtime cost of referring to the variable that was
inlined), but the reason it is considered so important is because
inlining a variable that is used in more than one place accomplishes
specialization. Inlining a definition also constructs a proof that
the specialized definition is used in exactly the one place where it
is used, but bringing the definition to the use and deleting the
reference is not the only way to do that. The idea of specialization
is also applicable more widely than inlining, because it is possible
(and desirable) to be able to specialize to clusters of similar
contexts, without further specializing to each of these contexts
individually.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
