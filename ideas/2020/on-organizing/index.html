    <p>Over the years, I have developed a fairly strong theory of how to
organize, and what the end-goal of organizing is. Since people
occasionally ask me, I figured I would write it down. Of course,
articulating also helps me refine my own understanding.
Without further ado,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Organizing a space has two goals:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To make it easy to pick up and put everything away.</li>
<li>To make it easy to get whatever is needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that just picking up and putting things somewhere is not
organizing: organizing is slower and more painful than picking up, but
we do it because it is a long-term investment in making picking up
easier. And because picking up without organizing makes finding
things later more difficult.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Organizing is about information first:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Making whoever picks up know where to put things away.</li>
<li>Making whoever needs a thing know where it is.</li>
<li>Making whoever may need a thing know which things are available.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Therefore, <em>clarity</em> is paramount.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A place is only a “place where something goes” if the boundary
separating that place from other places is unmistakable. As you
already know, that’s what containers are for: piles separated by air require
far more space to make unmistakably distinct than boxes separated by
walls.</li>
<li>A thing only goes in a place if it can’t go anywhere else.
Definitions of what goes in a place must be precise, unambiguous,
and exclusive. Some examples from my own household organization:
“Interior computer components”; “Data
(not power) cables”; “Hooks, except drapery hooks and command
hooks”; “Drapery hooks”.</li>
<li>Such precise definitions cannot be remembered, so that’s what labels
are for.</li>
<li>When you hold a thing in your hand, reading the label should
unambiguously tell you whether that thing should be put away in that
place.</li>
<li>When you hold a thing in your mind, reading the label should
unambiguously tell you whether that thing is to be found in that
place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Corollary: vague adjectives like “small” are to be avoided on labels,
unless the distribution of objects of that type in the household is
very strongly bimodal, so that “small” is actually unambigous in
context.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Organizing is about <em>flow</em> second:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The place where a commonly picked-up thing goes should be easy to
reach and close to where that thing tends to get dropped.</li>
<li>The place where a commonly used thing is stored should be easy to
reach and close to where that thing tends to be needed.</li>
<li>Things that are commonly picked up together or commonly used
together should be stored together.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why categories and containers should be the right size and
shape. Fishing for a golf ball at the bottom of a 64-quart tub of
“sports equipment” does not qualify as “easy to reach”. Conversely,
trying to puzzle-pack a toy airplane into an overflowing bin isn’t
“easy” either. Containers will have some extra space in them; that’s
ok. The space you get back by being able to put something on top of
or beside a container whose lid closes is worth more than the space
you lose by making that container big enough to always close its lid.</p>
<p>This, in turn, is why organizing is so personal. The right categories
and the right container sizes depend on what you have; and the right
places for the containers depend on how and how much you use what you
have.</p>
<p>This is also why organizing is so slow. It requires clarity about
every single object: what is it, what is it for, and how, when, and
where is it used. And when a space is shared, that clarity needs to
be shared between whoever is doing the organizing and everyone who
uses the space and the objects. And, of course, people’s needs and
habits change over time, and with them change their uses of objects.
Marie Kondo’s insight is that choosing not to own an object is often
less long-term work than continually understanding, supporting, and
communicating that object’s evolving purpose.</p>
<p>The rest is technique. A label printer;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> keeping things
vertical; stackable containers; shelves vs drawers vs hanging rods vs
pegboards; neverending streams of organization products; tradeoffs
between storage space and aesthetics. Those are matters of practice
and style that will fall into place behind the dual needs of clarity
and flow.</p>
