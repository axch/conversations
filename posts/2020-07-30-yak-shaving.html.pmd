Every once in a while someone hears me use the phrase "yak shaving" to
describe some activity and asks what I mean.  Here is a superb example
from my recent life: READMORE

1. I want to lower the interest rate on my mortgage.
2. So I start an application to refinance.
3. During the application, I discover that my credit score is lower
   than I expect.
4. So I pull my credit reports, and find an error.
5. In order to dispute the error, I must supply supporting documents,
   including statements from the relevant credit card.
6. I go to the web site of the credit card processor to download the
   statements.
7. The problem happened because of a change of credit card processors,
   so the new one doesn't have an online copy of the statement before
   the change, which I want to include in my dispute packet.
8. The old processor doesn't have the statement either, so I have to
   scan the paper copy from my records.
9. I don't have a scanner, so I photograph the pages one by one with my
   phone.
10. They come out as separate jpegs, but I want to convert them to pdf
    to re-collate them into documents with pages.
11. But when I run imagemagick to do that, it says "Not authorized",
    which turns out to be due to a security vulnerability in GhostScript
    9.24.
12. The vulnerability has since been patched, but the over-careful
    imagemagick configuration remains, so I must edit my imagemagick
    config file to authorize converting jpegs to pdf.
13. The location of this configuration file is tattooed on the hide of a
    Bedouin yak, and the only way to discover it is to guess the correct
    yak and remove enough of its hair.
14. So here I am in the desert, razor in hand, diligently shaving yaks,
    because I wanted to lower the interest rate on my mortgage.

Doing this kind of task for this kind of reason is called "yak shaving".
