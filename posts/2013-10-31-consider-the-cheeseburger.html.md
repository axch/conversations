Advertising.  People in my social circle are used to thinking of it as being an
awful institution: greedy, faceless, unscrupulous corporations
brainwashing the susceptible masses into wasting their hard-earned
money on cheap, low quality, superfluous devices for solving problems
no one actually has and that don't even work.  An irritation at best,
sheer deceit and manipulation at worst.  But in fact, what evils
afflict the institution of advertising are reflections of its poor
implementation, not of its superfluity.  The reason advertising exists is
READMORE that it is chewing on one of the most important problems in an economy
as large as ours: You have 300,000,000 people in the country, which have
needs, desires, and abilities.  How do you arrange to take the best
advantage of their abilities, do the best job of meeting their needs,
and turn a reasonable eye towards their desires, too?

Consider the cheeseburger: someone raised a cow, someone slaughtered
it, and someone shipped its meat to various places; someone grew some
corn, someone made it into oil, and someone transported the oil hither
and yon; someone mined some iron ore, someone smelted it and made
iron, someone mixed it in a furnace with carbon, someone crafted it
(who knows how) into shape, someone made frying pans out of some of
it, someone made a stove out of some, and someone transported the
frying pans and the stove; someone else grew some wheat, someone
ground it into meal, someone cultivated some yeast, someone cooked it
into buns, and someone shipped all this to and fro and eventually to
the same place as the stove, the pans, the oil, and the meat; someone
grew tomatoes, someone else grew lettuce, someone else grew onions,
and these too were all brought there; someone grew cucumbers, someone
mined salt, someone brined the cucumbers in the salt to make pickles,
and someone brought them; someone raised a milk cow, someone milked
it, someone extracted rennet out of another cow, someone developed a
good strain of cheese microbes, someone cultured the milk into cheese,
and someone brought the cheese; someone mined coal, someone built a
steam turbine, someone bruned the coal, someone built electric
transmission lines, and someone wired up that stove to those
transmission lines in that place; and finally someone cooked the meat
in the oil on the pan on the stove, melted the cheese onto it, cut the
tomatoes, onions, lettuce and pickles, put them all between the buns,
and gave them to you.  Never mind the copper for the transmission
lines, the vehicles for transportation, the fuel to run them, the
materials and construction for the roads for this transportation and
for the building in which you were given this cheeseburger, and
everything that goes into making enough cheeseburgers to feed all
these people.  And why did the world do this herculean thing?  Because
it guessed, more or less right, that you would have a hankering for a
cheeseburger just then, and that it was worth mobilizing all that
mechanism to satisfy you.

Of course, none of this would be possible at all if not for the fact
that raising one cow for meat contributes to a vast number of
cheeseburgers; and indeed, everything I mentioned has plenty of uses
besides the one cheeseburger that touched it in this little vignette.
But I hope I convinced you of the fundamental immensity of the
coordination problem.  The cooperation problem, namely getting all the
people involved in this story to want to help you get your
cheeseburger, is more or less solved by money: each of them will get
paid some small fraction of the price of your cheeseburger, and given
the number of cheeseburgers they helped with their respective actions,
those small fractions will add up to a more or less decent salary;
which in turn will allow them to command similar help from similar networks
to satisfy needs or wishes of their own.  But what about the
coordination problem?  How does the guy with the cows know how many to
raise and how many to slaughter?  How does the guy in the truck know
where to go to pick things up and where to go to drop them off?  And
how do you know that you could come to this place and receive this
cheeseburger?  This is a tremendous, mammoth problem of communication,
historically approached by guesses, small meetings, and public
displays (read: store fronts for centuries, also bill boards now).
Now that we have invented technology to make communication easier and
faster, what is the biggest communication-related economic problem
there is to solve?  Are you surprised that advertising online is huge
business?

That said, the current model is primitive.  The effort of doing the
communication is funded exclusively by the sellers of goods and
services, and takes the form of a more or less targeted broadcast,
which it is up to the buyers to filter for what they want.  Being
seller-dominated, these broadcasts are, from the perspective of the
buyers, biased, unreliable, and far too numerous.  The problem that
this system is trying to address, however poorly it addresses it
relative to potential, is nonetheless one of the vital underpinnings
of our society.
